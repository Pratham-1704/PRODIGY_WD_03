Here's a paragraph description for the Tic-Tac-Toe web application to include in your README file:

---

This project is a simple yet interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed for two players, the game allows users to take turns clicking on a 3x3 grid to place their respective marks, either X or O. The game logic is implemented to automatically check for winning combinations after each move, declaring a winner when three marks align in a row, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game detects a draw and updates the status accordingly. Additionally, a reset button is provided, allowing players to start a new match at any time. The project utilizes HTML to structure the game board, CSS to style the interface for a clean and user-friendly experience, and JavaScript to handle the interactive elements and core game functionality. This Tic-Tac-Toe web application serves as a foundational example of building a classic game with basic web technologies, making it an excellent starting point for anyone interested in creating simple, interactive web applications.
